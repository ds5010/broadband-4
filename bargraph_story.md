# **Comparing Maine County Covered Population Percentages**
Shown on this page are the series of bar graphs that compare all 16 Maine counties based on what percent of their covered populations are...<br>
1. [Low Income/Poverty](#1)
2. [Age 60 Years and Older](#2)
3. [Incarcerated](#3)
4. [With Disability](#4)
5. [Veterans](#5)
6. [With a Language Barrier](#6)
7. [Minority](#7)
8. [Living in Rural Areas](#8)<br>

In the upper right corner of each bar graph is a list of the top 5 counties in that category. The actual calculated percentages will also be displayed over each bar in the graph. All digital equity data was based off of the most recent 5-year ACS estimates (2015-2019) from the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/community-resilience-estimates/partnerships/ntia/digital-equity.html).

## Bar Graphs
### *<a id="1"></a>Low Income/Poverty:*
Covered populations were considered low income/poverty if their income was no more than 150% of the federal poverty threshold.

### *<a id="2"></a>Age 60 Years and Older:*

</p><br>

### *<a id="3"></a>Incarcerated:*
Covered populations consisted of those incarcerated in a state or local correctional facility, excluding federal facilities. The most notable trend here is the disparity between Knox County's incarceration percentage compared to the rest of Maine. While almost 3% of Knox's population (covered population) is incarcerated, less than 0.6% are incarcerated in all other counties.

### *<a id="4"></a>Disability:*
Covered populations consisted of those with one or more disabilities.

### *<a id="5"></a>Veterans:*
Covered populations consisted of veterans who were age 18 and older.

### *<a id="6"></a>Language Barrier:*
Covered populations were considered to have a language barrier if they spoke English less than "very well" or had low levels of literacy.

### *<a id="7"></a>Minority:*
Covered populations were considered minority if they identified as a race other than White alone or as Hispanic or Latino of any race. A likely influence in these results (and perhaps in some of the other bar graphs) are the locations of Maine's federally recognized Tribal Reservations. Maine has four Native American tribes, the Maliseet, Micmac, Passamaquoddy and Penobscot—collectively known as the Wabanaki, or “People of the Dawnland”. Washington county in particular is home to two Passamaquoddy reservations. You can learn more about these tribes [here](https://umaine.edu/hudsonmuseum/exhibits/online/tree/tribal-map/#:~:text=The%20Passamaquoddy%20tribe%20is%20located,Point%20and%20Odeneg%20in%20Princeton.)!

### *<a id="8"></a>Rural Living:*
Unsurprisingly, most of Maine is considered 100% rural with the exception of parts of Penobscot, York, Androscoggin, and Cumberland (rather than the top 5, this graph should look at the top 12). In fact, with the exception of Androscoggin and Cumberland, all counties in maine are mostly rural.

## Other Trends
Including the rural living category where 12 counties boasted the same #1 scores, the following counties showed up # number of times in the top 5 (of the 8 categories):

| County | #Times in Top 5 | Categories |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Washington | 8 | Low income/poverty (2nd), Age 60+ (5th), Incarcerated (2nd), Disability (3rd), Veterans (4th), Language Barrier (2nd), Minority (1st), Rural (tied 1st w/ 11 others) |
| Piscataquis | 6 | Low income/poverty (3rd), Age 60+ (2nd), Disability (1st), Veterans (tied for 1st with 1 other), Language Barrier (5th), Rural (tied 1st w/ 11 others) |
| Aroostook | 5 | Low income/poverty (4th), Disability (2nd), Language Barrier (1st), Minority (5th), Rural (tied 1st w/ 11 others) |
| Somerset | 5 | Low income/poverty (1st), Incarcerated (tied for 5th with 2 others), Disability (4th), Language Barrier (3rd), Rural (tied 1st w/ 11 others) |
| Lincoln | 4 | Age 60+ (1st), Incarcerated (tied for 3rd with 1 other), Veterans(3rd), Rural (tied 1st w/ 11 others) |
| Knox | 3 | Age 60+ (3rd), Incarcerated (1st), Rural (tied 1st w/ 11 others) |
| Penobscot | 3 | Incarcerated (tied for 5th with 2 others), Disability (5th), Minority (4th) |
| Oxford | 2 | Low income/poverty (5th), Rural (tied 1st w/ 11 others) |
| Cumberland | 2 | Incarcerated (tied for 3rd with 1 other), Minority (2nd) |
| Hancock | 2 | Age 60+ (4th), Rural (tied 1st w/ 11 others) |
| Kennebec | 2 | Incarcerated (tied for 5th with 2 others), Rural (tied 1st w/ 11 others) |
| Sagadahoc | 2 | Veterans (tied for 1st with 1 other), Rural (tied 1st w/ 11 others) |
| Franklin | 2 | Veterans (5th), Rural (tied 1st w/ 11 others) |
| Androscoggin | 2 | Language Barrier (4th), Minority (3rd) |
| Waldo | 1 | Rural (tied 1st w/ 11 others) |
| York | 0 | - |

* Washington county showed up in the top 5 of all 8 categories (this is including the "rural" category where 12 of 16 counties were all 100% rural)
* York is the only county not to have shown up in the top 5 of these 8 categories.
* Because almost all of Maine is considered rural, weighing the "rural" category the same as the other categories may lead to skewed conclusions.
